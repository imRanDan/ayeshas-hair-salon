## How It's Made:
I wanted to work on strengthing my responsive web design skills, and to keep the tech simple, I worked with HTML5 and CSS3. I used a mobile-first approach to design each section one at a time. 

**Tech used:** HTML5 - CSS3

## Optimizations

If I had more time I would have built more pages for the sake of organizing the information but decided on keeping it simple with a landing page where all necessary info is viewable.

## Lessons Learned:

Learning more about mobile responsiveness and following a mobile-first approach has changed my way of building applications from the ground-up.
